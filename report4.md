**Keys:** `<ctrl-v> <enter> <"my password"> <enter>`

From my computer, I had the login command copied onto my clipboard and used the pasted command, `ctrl-v`, to quickly have the command on terminal and hit `enter` to prompt me to my password. Then I typed in my personal password and hit `enter` to log into my ieng6 account.

**Keys:** `<ctrl-c> <ctrl-v> <enter>`

Under Lab Tasks in the class website, I copied the link and the git clone command, using the copying command, `ctrl-c`, and pasting it into terminal, finally hitting `enter` to clone the lab files into my ieng6 account.

In order to see what files I had in my freshly cloned account, I used the command, `ls` to locate "lab7". Then I used the command, `cd` (cd lab7) to change my directory into where I needed to go. Lastly, I ran `test.sh` (bash test.sh), in order to see the amount of failed tests.
