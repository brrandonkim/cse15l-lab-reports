# Hello Incoming CSE 15L Students!

This post will teach you how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`. 

**Step 1: Logging into your CSE 15L Account**

1. Click this link: [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
  * Then proceed to log in using the asked information
  * Your page should look like this: <img width="1494" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-08 at 7 48 04 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110199983/230751497-d18b09a8-06df-4c18-baa7-c1e3580a2bd9.png">
2. Then please click on your course-specific account name which starts with the 8 letter characters "*cs15sp23*" (The first 8 characters vary depending on the course and quarter taken.)
  * After doing so it should look like this: <img width="1491" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-08 at 7 50 36 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110199983/230751571-541bc19f-4314-468b-b483-04b98f90f6af.png">
3. Please click on the **Global Password Change Tool** and proceed to change/add your password to this course-specific account.
4. You should be set! Make sure to try logging in with your new username and password.
> The purpose of this is to connect to your account to the **remote** server.

**Step 2: Downloading and Setting Up Visual Studio Code**

1. Click this link to download *VSCode*: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Please download the version based on your operating system.
  * Depending on what operating system and settings, open *VSCode* and it should look similar to this: <img width="1284" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-09 at 2 49 37 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110199983/230766072-189623b9-ee71-4d80-9611-2974669f1818.png">
  * Keep in mind, whenever you see a chunk of code in light gray, it is specifying that the code block is running on the remote server. For example:
    `  $ this is a command to the remote server`
